Abstract:
=========================================================================================================
Several imaging and graphics applications usually require the resizing/retargeting
of the spatial resolution of a given image. In real time applications, the retargeting
process is expected to be computationally fast and free of any visually disturbing structural
distortions. Accordingly, several content-aware retargeting methods, which resize images while
preserving important image structures, have been introduced. However, it has also been shown 
that finding a single method that can be effectively applicable in all types of situation is 
very challenging. Specifically, many of the existing methods are not capable of avoiding visible 
structural distortions during high level of image squeezing or stretching processes. The distortions 
become even more evident with the presence of numerous high frequency contents. Accordingly, we 
have proposed a new and efficient image retargeting method which is based on Radial Basis Function 
(RBF) interpolation. We have introduced a novel pre-processing step and modifications to the generic 
form of the RBF interpolation technique for a better structural as well as size preservation of 
important image regions. The method is finally evaluated with respect to prior retargeting methods 
and leads to improved performances, both in terms of quality and complexity measures.
